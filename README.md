Worried your homepage will be cluttered with posts? I have made sure to include pagination specifically for this issue 
  
Want to find a post but you can't remember the content? I have created search functionality that will predict what you are typing and return to you the best results!

When logging in, if "remember me" is checked, even if you close your browser you won't have to re-login! 

Discussion in real time! use the live chat feature to talk to other about topics you care about!
